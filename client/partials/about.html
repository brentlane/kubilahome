    <p>Delivering great Software Products is hard.</p>
    <p>Not because writing software is hard, though sometimes it is.</p>
    <p>Building great products starts with people, and ends with people</p>

    <p>The key is surrounding yourself great people who build software</p>
    <p>And finding customers who can't live without your products</p>
