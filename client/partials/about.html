    <p>Delivering great Software Products is hard.</p>
    <p>Not because writing software is hard, though sometimes it is.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Building great products starts with people, and finishes with people.</p>
    </br>
    <p>The key is surrounding yourself with great people who love to build software.</p>
    </br>
    <p>And building solutions that customers just can't live without.</p>
